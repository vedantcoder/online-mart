home page we can select user role then login and then redirect to the user specific section
of the website like if its customer login go to the amazon like customer interface which has all the 
product catalouge and categories cart and order recommendations everything as per the requirements mentioned 
below


frameworks can be used
we need not force the usage of classes and objects everywhere but adviced to use

Class Diagrams: At a minimum, design classes for:

User (Perhaps an abstract base class)

Customer (inherits from User)

Retailer (inherits from User)

Wholesaler (inherits from User)

Product / Item

Inventory

Order

Cart

Here is a comprehensive checklist based only on the provided project document, organized by the evaluation rubric to help you target all 120 marks.

✅ Project Requirements Checklist
This checklist is broken down by the Evaluation Rubric  to ensure you meet every graded component.

1. Functionality Implementation (60 Marks)
This is the largest part of your grade. It requires a working implementation of all mandatory modules.

Authentication: Implement authentication via OTP.


Social Logins: Include options for Google and/or Facebook logins.


Location: Integrate Google API for location services.


☐ Module 2: User Dashboards 


Item Listing: Show category-wise item listings with images.


Item Details: Display price, stock status, and availability date for items.


Proxy Availability: Retailers must be able to show items that are available via their wholesaler (even if not in their own stock).

☐ Module 3: Search & Navigation 


Smart Filtering: Implement filters for cost, quantity, and stock availability.


Location-Based Listings: Provide location-based shop listings.


Distance Filters: Allow users to filter for nearby options.

☐ Module 4: Order & Payment Management 


Order Placement: Support both online and offline order placement.


Calendar Integration: For offline orders, integrate a calendar with reminders.


Order Tracking: Implement real-time tracking with delivery details, status updates, and notifications.


Stock Updates: Stock must update automatically after transactions.

☐ Module 5: Feedback & Dashboard Updates 


Status Updates: Provide real-time order status updates.


Confirmations: Send delivery confirmations via SMS and/or e-mail.



Feedback Collection: Allow for product-specific feedback collection.


Feedback Display: Make collected feedback visible on item pages.

☐ User Hierarchy & Roles 

Customer Role:

Browse, search, and filter items.

Add to cart, place orders, and make payments.

Provide feedback and raise queries.

Retailer Role:

Manage inventory (add/delete/update items, set pricing).

Track customers' purchase history.

Place and manage orders with wholesalers.

Handle payments and customer queries.

Wholesaler Role:

Manage inventory for retailers.

Set item pricing.

Maintain retailer purchase/transaction history.

Update stock after retailer orders.

2. Technical Depth (15 Marks)

Code Quality: Ensure your code is well-structured and maintainable.

API Usage (Mandatory):

Use the Google API (for location).


Use payment gateways (e.g., a test version of Stripe, etc.).


Third-Party Integration: Show integration with services like SMS/email for notifications.



Scalability: Design the system with scalability in mind.


Modern Tech: Actively use modern advanced technology, platforms, or paradigms, as high use will attract high grades. You are encouraged to use available APIs and packages, not build from scratch.


3. Documentation & Presentation (15 Marks)
Project Report:

Submit a complete and clear PDF report.


Report must include your System Design & Architecture.

Video Presentation:

Record a 15-20 minute video presentation.

The video must be a demo of the working application.


All group members must be involved in the video.

In the video, each member must introduce themselves.

In the video, each member must explain the functioning of the module(s) they worked on.

4. Innovation & User Experience (10 Marks)

Personalized Recommendations: Implement this value-added feature (e.g., based on browsing/purchase history).


UI/UX Design:

Ensure a good, creative UI/UX design.


Ensure ease of navigation.

Provide appropriate links to transition between options.


Crucial: Maintain a difference in the GUI for the "user" vs. the "delivery person".


Responsiveness: The application should be mobile or web responsive.


Localized Products: The app must be able to highlight region-specific local products.


5. System Design & Architecture (10 Marks)

Problem Understanding: Your design (and report) must show a clear understanding of the problem.


Prototype Development Plan: Show clear planning in the development of the prototype (e.g., class diagrams, database schema, flowcharts) in your report.

6. Testing & Validation (10 Marks)

Testing Types: Show evidence of unit testing and integration testing.


Bug Resolution: Demonstrate that bugs have been found and resolved.

Edge Case Handling: Your application must gracefully handle edge cases, specifically:

Stock unavailability.

Payment failure.

proper api usage for payment maps etc etc
