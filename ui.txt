Clean dashboard layout
Use a left vertical sidebar for navigation and a top bar for page-specific actions.
This creates a consistent mental model and reduces UI complexity.
The main content area stays uncluttered, perfect for data views, forms, or workflow screens.
Keep the sidebar minimal with only icons and short labels.

Card based content structure
Break each functional block into a card.
Cards allow modular growth of the UI and make the interface look structured even if features expand later.
Each card contains one job: data summary, form input, action buttons, or visual status.

Context-driven modals
Avoid multi-page forms.
Use small modals for quick actions like editing, adding entries, or confirmations.
This saves time both for users and for you when building the app.

State-aware components
Add small cues like badge counts, color indicators, and disabled states that show system status.
Helps make the app feel alive without complex animation work.

Notification zone
Simple toast notifications reinforce clarity when actions succeed or fail.
Make them color coded using a predictable palette.

Multi step workflows with breadcrumb style header
For any operation involving 2 or more steps, stack views under a breadcrumb.
This avoids user confusion, especially in management dashboards or approvals.

Mobile responsive grid
Use a 12 column grid that collapses gracefully.
Cards become full width on mobile.
Navigation collapses into a top hamburger.
Focus on vertical stacking on small screens.

Practical color theme
Pick a restrained 2 color palette plus neutrals.
One primary color for interactions.
One accent color for alerts or highlights.
Keep backgrounds neutral so content stands out.

Icon consistency
Use a single library like Lucide or Material Icons so nothing looks mismatched.
Restrict to a small set and repeat them so the UI looks coherent.

Reusable components
Design small pieces that you can reuse everywhere.
Input field
Section heading
Card
Modal
Toast
Button
Table row
This will cut your frontend development time in half.

Authentication screens
Keep auth screens extremely simple.
Centered card layout
Two inputs
One button
Small subtitles
A minimal brand logo
Do not overdesign sign in or sign up.

Data heavy pages
For tables, provide three utilities:
Search
Sort
Filter
Add a small toolbar to the top right of the table instead of scattering controls.
Allow row selection for bulk actions.

Focus on readability
Use a large base font and comfortable spacing.
This increases perceived polish without any complexity.
Typography should feel similar to Stripe or Linear.

Loading states and skeletons
Use skeletons for long fetches.
Make animation subtle and clean.
It gives the UX a feel of speed even if the backend is slow initially.

Error boundary screen
Have a clean global error page.
Use a simple icon, a short message, and a reset button.
Users trust apps more when even errors look intentional.
